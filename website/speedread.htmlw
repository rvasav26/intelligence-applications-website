        Thousands of years ago, India was home to the Indus Valley civilization,
        one of the world's oldest civilizations. In the 300s and 200s BC, the
        Maurya Empire ruled the land. It became one of the largest empires in
        the world. Years later, the Golden Age of India would take place during
        the Gupta dynasty. Lasting from 319 to 554 AD, the Gupta dynasty
        produced new developments in science, great art, and advanced
        culture.<br /><br />

        With the rise of Islam in the Arab nations, it began to spread into
        India. During the 10th and 11th centuries the Turks and the Afghans
        invaded India and ruled as the Delhi Sultanate. Years later the Mughal
        Empire would rise to power and rule the land for over 300 years.<br /><br />

        In the 16th century, European explorers began to enter India. Britain
        eventually took control of India. In the early 1900s India began to
        fight for independence from Britain. Led by Mohandas Gandhi, non-violent
        protests were made against the British. After many years of struggling,
        India was granted independence from Britain in 1947.<br /><br />

        The country was later divided up into India and Pakistan. Later East
        Pakistan became a third country, Bangladesh. India and Pakistan have had
        strained relations over the years including both countries testing
        nuclear weapons.<br /><br />

        India does have significant problems including poverty, corruption, and
        overpopulation. However, the country has recently seen strong economic
        and technology development.<br /><br />
